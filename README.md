## Setup

Start by running `uv self update` to make sure you're on the latest version of uv.

And now simply run:  
`uv sync`  
And marvel at the speed and reliability! If necessary, uv should install python 3.12, and then it should install all the packages.
If you get an error about "invalid certificate" while running `uv sync`, then please try this instead:  
`uv --native-tls sync`  
And also try this instead:  
`uv --allow-insecure-host github.com sync`

Finally, run these commands to be ready to use CrewAI:  
`uv tool install crewai`   
Followed by:  
`uv tool upgrade crewai`  

Checking that everything is set up nicely:  
1. Confirm that you now have a folder called '.venv' in your project root directory (agents)
2. If you run `uv python list` you should see a Python 3.12 version in your list (there might be several)
3. If you run `uv tool list` you should see crewai as a tool

Just FYI on using uv:  
With uv, you do a few things differently:  
- Instead of `pip install xxx` you do `uv add xxx` - it gets included in your `pyproject.toml` file and will be automatically installed next time you need it  
- Instead of `python my_script.py` you do `uv run my_script.py` which updates and activates the environment and calls your script  
- You don't actually need to run `uv sync` because uv does this for you whenever you call `uv run`  
- It's better not to edit pyproject.toml yourself, and definitely don't edit uv.lock. If you want to upgrade all your packages, run `uv lock --upgrade`
- uv has really terrific docs [here](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) - well worth a read!
